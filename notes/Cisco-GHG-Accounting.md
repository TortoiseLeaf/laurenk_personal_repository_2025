Financial boundaries are what the company pays for 
Operational boundaries are your companies activities and their emissions

upstream and downstream is before and after production

Scope 1,2,3 of how directly and indirectly emissions are to your business

should calculate all operational boundaries, not everything needs to be reported though.

Companies in collaboration should allocate emissions to avoid double counting for the same emission source.

those are the GHG inventory boundaries.

Map the value chain:
now you've inventoried everything, map all the steps it takes to organize the flows at all levels of the chain.

Gather data from all suppliers and transport between them (upstream)
Gather data from distribution (downstream)

Scope 1 GHG Inventory

Stationary combustion like boilers gennys, furnaces
Mobile combustion like transport
Fugitive emissions, leaks in aircon, refrigeration etc
Process Emissions, released in chemical manufacturing processes


Scope 2 Inventory

indirect emissions from purchased leccy, heat and steam.
Location based method, calculate emissions by that regions avg intensity

Market based method calculates it based on supplier-specific data

electric vehicles actually count as scope 2 because it's leccy?

Scope 3 Inventory
emissions within the value chain.

Upstream emissions activities like raw materials, suppliers, manufacturers, waste generated

Downstream emissions activities, distributions and consumers, use of the products, end of life treatment or disposal. franchises and investments.


identifying them and categorising them by sector is interesting because each is niche with different needs. Look at categories likely for your sector and footprint.

-----------------
Direct measurement of composition and volume of gases on-site

Activity based data, physical units from activities 

Spend-based data, monitoring amounts spent on activities. instead of physical units, using financial data

direct is most accurate and expensive or difficult to obtain
spend-based it easy to get but typically least accurate.

most important to choose methods that align with your company
document everything, bad ghg is better than none.

activity based data is a good middle ground, like an electricity bill
take the numbers, multiply them by emissions factors relative to the location

spend based data looks at receipts and invoices etc.
the amount spent gets multiplied by sector specific factors to calculate the emissions spent.

can use hybrid approaches that combine data sources, unique methods and or multiple approaches.


Best practices for data collection are 
Consistency, use the same method every year. if you make significant changes to how you calculate it you need to use that on previous years to make it consistent again.

integrate new ghg systems into your system like tracking systems and stuff

focus on accuracy over precision when resources are limited.

Document everything, methods, sources, assumptions and estimates.


Scope 1 Data collection
mobile vehicles are direct ghg emitters 
list of vehicles owned or leased,
fuel type, used, distance travelled, otherwise fuel economy
Vehicle type year and model

ideally comes from fuel gauges but that's a lot. better to regularly collect all data

activity based data when you don't have the direct info recorded.

spend based data is bad for this because fuel prices vary wildly from place to place.
total amount travelled / the cost of fuel / the avg price 
it's an estimate but sometimes necessary, better than nothing.


How to apply emissions factors

Emission factor = emissions (10 KG Co2eq) / Activity Data (1 gallon diesel)

use data conversion tables, error checking and caution


range of sources for emission factors, can be sector specific, regional specific
Always source from reliable sources like IPCC and government guidelines
Find ones that most closely match your specific business activity.

Climatiqs data explorer
European investment bank emission factor
IPCC report
IDE International electricity factors
IED emission factors (Paid)
PCAF European buildings emissions factor database
US EPA GHG Emission factors hub
US EPA - EEIO factors
US EPA eGRID
UK DEFRA Conversion Factors

CEDA
EcoInvent
ExioBase
ICE Database


Can convert emissions factors to CO2 equivalent using GWP

Co2, methane, NOS, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexaflouride, nitrogren triflouride 

higher GWP = greater heat trapping ability relative to CO2
Always check units and GWP values when converting to CO2 equivalent


emission factor * activity data = emissions

Ensure the units are the same everywhere, or converted if not. cm = cm not inches

Founded in 2011, technova is a mid-sized it hardware manufacturing company with 84 employees
- NYC HQ
- Manufacturing facility & warehouse in Dallas, TX
- Owns 10 diesel powered delivery trucks

Technova seeks to calculate it's GHG emissions baseline for Jan 1, 2024 to Dec 1 2024
to report to its board of directors and include in marketing materials

They  want to ensure the GHG measurement and results are aligned with leading industry standards and best practices.

Scope and objectives
1. Manually calculate Technovas 2024 scope 1 & 2 emissions, by leveraging data, unit convesions and emission factors
2. Effectively communicate results to technobas board and customers
3. identify insights and provide emission reduction recommendation to technova

What steps are needed to complete an accurate baseline inventory for them?

________________

scope 3 emissions can be stuff you buy from other people, so their scopes also affect yours

significant upstream scope 3 can be like transportation and distribution, capital goods and things like data centres for the services you use.

Can make transitions from fossil fuel uses to greener versions.


Downstream scope 3 can be like route optimization software to cut down on transport emissions.
Fulfilment centres that remove some delivery trucks, changing to electric vehicles etc.

Proper recycling systems for products end of life etc


ensures sustainable business growth
