Has a checklist and quotes the ISOs for mobile dev


Find a list of carbon sinks

find carbon friendly events in nature 

plankton, moss, mushrooms etc,

"this is found in x part of the world"

make it interesting

can use cars etc as examples but negative reinforcement is shitty (cite)
you already feel disempowered and alienated from nature so we don't need to reinforce that. What's better is to encourage curiosity and connection. A sense of self in your actions having counter parts
