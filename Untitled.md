### What sustainability issue are you addressing, and why? (max 200 words):  *****
Media apps are designed to scroll endlessly with no apparent physical cost, but the cost to the climate and to our physical and mental wellbeing is there.
The project aims to help create informed consumers by showing the user the physical cost of their online habits, and then by quantifying it against interesting CO2 sink events in nature and offering links to relevant charities and initiatives, hoping to make the natural world feel more accessible to the user. 
It aims also to function as a tool to mitigate the screen time overuse of intentionally addictive media applications. Ultimately the project hopes to integrate into the digital health layer of our devices, to better empower the user over their own digital health and provide a reminder of our proximity to the natural world, while we engage in the habitual online activities that can make us feel most removed from it. 


### In one paragraph, describe your idea (max 250 words): *****
A digital wellbeing app that silently tracks the users screen time spent on social media apps, converts the minutes into CO2eq, and compares CO2eq cost to events in the natural world, offering suggestions to offset and/or links to relevant charities to make initiatives more accessible. 
There are plans to incorporate a local tree planting initiative to plant 1 tree for every x.Kg of CO2eq saved.


### What support will you need from UHI (e.g. staff, budget help, comms)? *****
Guidance from Delivery staff on project development and longevity, help with pitches or applications. Coordination with other UHI students for tree planting, and help from UHI to budget in the resources and efforts/manpower for the tree planting initiative.
Guidance on legitimising the project legally as a viable product at the projects finish and release.

### Breakdown of how the funding would be used (bullet list acceptable) *****
- Development costs
	- Different dev teams, frontend, backend, security, legal
- Release/Production costs (will look to do this as freely as possible)
- Google app store listing costs
- Tree planting resources (fuel, saplings, tools, coordination/logistics meetings, manpower)
- Marketing(?)
