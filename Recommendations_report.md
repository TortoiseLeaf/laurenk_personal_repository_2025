### Executive Summary

_Begin with an “executive summary” that briefly introduces and summarizes your purpose for writing this report. This section establishes reader expectations for what is to follow. Make sure to state clearly here your reasons for writing this report, and what is contained within the report._

The purpose of this report is to explore possible solutions to the problem of social media overuse and its cost to the climate, and concluding in a recommendation for how to proceed. The document will explore ways in which digital wellbeing tools can be used for social media reduction and for promoting carbon literacy, to the immediate and long-term benefit of both the individual and greater environment.  
### Problem Statement

The problem is that highly addictive social media applications contribute to phone addiction and overuse, where “In 2025, 61% of smartphone addicts said social media was the primary reason they couldn’t reduce their phone usage.” (Lee. 2025). This is an issue proven to be linked to unhappiness, mental unwellness and even psychiatric disorders (Surg. A. _et al._ 2023). 
The physical environmental cost of social media use is also significant, with "the average time spent per user [on social media applications]...one user/day...is the equivalent of 1.4 km in a light vehicle."(Derudder. 2021)
The problem is twofold and intersects between the detrimental effect of Social media and phone overuse on the health of the individual, and also the greater environment. 


_All recommendation reports address a real and important problem. The Problem Statement is perhaps the most important part of the report because it articulates this problem clearly, providing a strong sense of need for the options you will explore in the rest of the report. The Problem Statement is where you justify the purpose of this report._

_To justify the options you recommend, you must first understand the specific needs of the business, organization, or stakeholders you are writing for (i.e. What does the organization need? Why? What is the background of this problem? Who are the major stakeholders? What has been tried in the past? Why didn’t it work?). Your Problem Statement will serve as your introduction to the options discussed in this report._

### Description of Options

_This is the heart of a recommendation report. In this section, you describe a set number of possible ideas (typically 3) for solving the problem cited at the beginning of your report. Your ideas should be creative and well-planned. Each option (which should be described in 1-2 paragraphs) should include the following information:_

- a cohesive, comprehensive overview of this option/idea;
- information about how this option answers the need cited at the beginning of your report;
- specific details about how this idea could be implemented; and
- justifications as to why this option will work.

1. Social media tracker with CO2 conversions and tree planting
	A digital wellbeing tool that tracks screen time across social media applications, converts minutes spent into CO2e and compares the users CO2e usage with natural world CO2 sink events. When user screentime reduction goals are met, trees will be planted by domestic forestry initiatives. 
	By comparing CO2e usage to natural real-world events the application aims to provide alternative reading and encourage engagement with the outdoors, with the end goal of helping wean users off of highly addictive social media apps to benefit of their health and wellbeing.
	
2. Timer manager to prevent phone overuse, visual rewards on mobile
	An application that allows the user to lock specific applications after a certain period of time to avoid overuse. For every successful adherence to the locked application (i.e. if user obeys the time restriction and does not manually unlock the application), a visual reward is granted in the Timer manager app like a flower or plant within a garden. This aims to promote a feeling of calm, contentment and ownership over the users digital habits, and also aims to encourage an emotive consideration for the natural world.

3. Applications blocker focussed on self-help and offers mindful exercises
	An application that blocks offending applications and offers mindfulness exercises instead, like meditations and breathing exercises. A gallery of unlockable images of nature exists in-app for when screen time reduction goals are met.
	This solves the problem by reducing screen time on problematic applications and also helps the user take care of their health with mindfulness exercises and encourages interest in the outdoors with images of nature as unlockable rewards. 
### Evaluation Criteria & Evaluations of Each Option

_After describing the three options, you should outline criteria for evaluating those options. The criteria should be based on the information outlined in your Statement of Need. After listing and justifying evaluation criteria, you should evaluate each option based on its ability to answer your criteria._

Does it:
- reduce screentime
- improve user wellbeing
- encourage interest in the natural world
- improve user control over their digital habits

1. yes
2. 2/4 emphasis on screentime reduction and user control over habits
3. 3/4 emphasis on wellbeing and control over habits
### Final Recommendation

_After describing and evaluating your options, you will recommend the one you think is best and provide a discussion of the reasons why you recommend it. In other words, defend your recommendation thoroughly in this section._

After describing and evaluating these options, I will recommend the first option of the CO2e conversion and tree planting application. It informs the user of the physical weight of their digital habits and makes them real, and offers a real-world actionable reward of tree-planting linked to their efforts. This added reward could compound a sense of control and empowerment over user activity, and encourage an interest in the natural world by comparing the users digital habits with natural CO2 sink events in the wild. This is a good fit for achieving the end goal of  weaning users from highly addictive social media apps while encouraging engagement with the outdoors, to benefit both the health of the user and the greater environment where "studies [have] suggested a protective effect of exposure to natural environments on mental health outcomes and cognitive function." (Jimenez. _Et al_. 2021).

### Conclusion

_The conclusion to a recommendation report should re-emphasize the final recommendation and offer suggestions about how the audience/reader could move toward implementation._

### Works Cited

_Recommendation reports sometimes require in-depth research that can range from conducting interviews and surveys to reading peer-reviewed journal articles or other related documents. You should cite this information so that future readers can find the articles and resources you used. The citation style you use should be based on the industry you’re writing for; the chemical industry will expect ACS Style, medical professionals will expect AMA, humanities audiences will expect MLA, social sciences will expect APA, and so on._
