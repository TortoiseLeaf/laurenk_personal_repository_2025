MauiScreenTracker

A digital wellbeing app that runs silently in the background of users phones, tracking and collecting minutes spent daily on popular media and social media applications. The data collected is converted into CO2eq and displayed to the user alongside comparisons of their screentime CO2eq with interesting and varied CO2 sink events found in the natural world. The application should compare weekly usage with weeks previous, encouraging the user to reduce their screen time. If a set target of reduced screen time is met, 

to better inform the user and aim to incentivise healthier online habits. 

by planting 1 Tree per 0.5Kg/1Kg of CO2eq saved by the user. Initiative to help inform consumers and reconnect users with the natural world.

As global technological advances increase, culturally and physically our modern cultures are becoming increasingly removed from the natural world, to the detriment of our physical, mental and emotional health and also to significant detriment to the natural world. Recent media and social media platforms are designed explicitly to be addictive and can effectively subdue and isolate. The project hopes to in a small way give back some control to users by informing consumption 

The project hopes to begin a conversation around informed consumption 



digital wellbeing app that silently tracks user time spent on social media apps, converts the minutes into CO2eq, and compares CO2eq cost to events in the natural world, offering suggestions to offset and/or links to relevant charities to make initiatives more accessible.

Mobile media apps are designed to scroll endlessly with no apparent physical cost, but the cost to the climate and to our physical and mental wellbeing is there.
The project aims to help create informed consumers of mobile media apps by showing the user the physical cost of their online habits, and then by quantifying it against interesting CO2 sink events in nature and offering links to relevant charities and initiatives, hopes to make the natural world feel more accessible to the user. 

It aims also to function as a tool to help mitigate the screen time overuse of intentionally addictive media applications. Ultimately the project hopes to integrate a reminder of our proximity to the natural world into the habitual online activities that tend to make us feel most removed from it. 



ultimately to try and help people feel they have a closer proximity to the natural world. Aims to benefit people physically mentally and emotionally, and also stoke interest and connection to the natural world



  
  

**### What sustainability issue are you addressing, and why? (max 200 words):  *******

> _Media apps are designed to scroll endlessly with no apparent physical cost, but the cost to the climate and to our physical and mental wellbeing is there._
> 
> _The project aims to help divert user attentions from addictive media phone applications and redirect attentions towards interesting CO2 facts in the natural world instead, to the end of reminding users of their proximity to the outside world. This hopes to stoke interests in the natural world and reintroduce thinking about our natural environment in a (hopefully) empowering and engaging way, when we are on our phones and possibly often feeling far removed from it. By gamifying screen time reduction the hope it to reduce our individual carbon footprint from the datacentres used to churn out endless streams of social media.
