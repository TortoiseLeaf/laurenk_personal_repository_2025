| 1        | Agile                | Explain the industry standards in software project management including PRINCE2, ISO 10006, ISO 12207 along with the SEI's CMMI methods.  Integrate relevant standards into a project.                                                          |
| 2        | Business             | Use the principles of business transformation to create a recommendations report by being able to decompose and abstract a non-obvious business problem, structure it, collect relevant information, consider options and make recommendations. |
| 3        | Meta-skills**        | Evaluate how personal profiling tools predict team performance in a non-trivial project.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 4        | Security             | Research and evaluate the current threat landscape, trends and their significance.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 5        | Technical            | Profile the performance of existing code and be able to refactor where appropriate, considering improvements to efficiency, scalability, maintainability and extensibility.                                                                     |

1. Explain them all
	identify relevant ones and how to apply to project. Evidence applying them

2.  create recommendations report decomposing/abstracting a non-obvious business problem
3. use personal profiling tools to predict team performance
4. identify and evaluate current threat landscape, trends and their significance
5. profile code performance, refactor to improve efficiency, scalability, maintainability and extensibility (job CRUD)
