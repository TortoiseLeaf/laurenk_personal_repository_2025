"Yes, an app you build that collects and uses personal data can connect to the internet under GDPR, but only if you have a legal basis, obtain appropriate consent, and process the data fairly, lawfully, and transparently, with data transfers to the internet or any other recipients clearly outlined in your privacy policy. You must provide users with clear information and opt-in mechanisms for data processing, ensuring that data is secure and handled responsibly. 

Key GDPR Requirements for Apps Connecting to the Internet

1. **Lawful Basis:**
    
    You must have a valid legal reason (a "lawful basis" under Article 6 of the GDPR) to process personal data, and this includes any data that is transmitted or stored online. 
    

- **Transparency:**
    
    You must provide users with clear, understandable information about what personal data you collect, why you collect it, how it will be used, and with whom it will be shared, including any third parties or cloud providers. 
    

- **Consent:**
    
    Users must give explicit, informed consent before you collect and process their personal data for certain purposes. This consent should be granular (e.g., opt-in checkboxes) and can be withdrawn at any time. 
    

- **Purpose Limitation:**
    
    The personal data you collect can only be used for the specific, explicit, and legitimate purposes you've told the user about. 
    

- **Data Security:**
    
    Implement strong security measures, such as encryption and secure connections like HTTPS, to protect the data when it is being transmitted and stored online. 
    

- **Data Minimisation:**
    
    Only collect and retain personal data that is necessary for the specified purposes, and do not keep it for longer than required. 
    

- **International Data Transfers:**
    
    If you transfer data across borders (e.g., to a server in a different country), you must inform users about this and ensure there are adequate data protection safeguards in place. 
    

In summary: Connecting your app to the internet is possible, but you must always be able to justify the data processing, be completely transparent with your users, and ensure the data is handled securely and responsibly according to GDPR principles."

This YAML file is building the app successfully but now I need to push the build to the Play Store automatically. How do I do that?
