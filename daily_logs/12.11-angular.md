Hi everyone, here's an example of a .net 9 project that follows mvvm like ours, it should be helpful have a look around and become familiar with the app architecture to give an idea of how our app will roughly work too.

I've sent out invites to the repo again, please accept so you can be assigned to review pull requests (and contribute to the code!).

I'll try to create a basic usage collection method this week and get in touch later to see if we're happy the first release is met. Be great if folk can review the pull request for the permissions check. 


Over the holidays please can you:
- accept the invite to the repo
- clone the project and run it locally on an android emulator (here's a tutorial but if it doesn't work just troubleshoot or ask for help, 90% of soft dev is googling https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdgYUiIdkgE&t=17s)

Cheers and best!
