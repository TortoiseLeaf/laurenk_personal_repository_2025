# Simone notes

big companies are more structured
small companies are less but still structured

software engineer role
seniority you become less code

doing investigations, creating requirements, then planning those
what is it we're building, giving updates to the team. talking about challenges, asking for help and providing help

balance between technical and soft skills
is it someone I would love to work with?

juniors getting annoyed at not spending enough time coding.
- trick is to work on your skills at the level you can solve most problems quickly
- hacker rank, leet code for practice
- all continuing to learn*

technical challenge you will need to think for a long time. most times you should look at a challenge and know how to fix it, outline it and then just coding it.

not expecting someone out of university to know this 

computer science principles, architecture

if you have a language understand the concepts and how to put it together very well
demonstrable and practical understanding 
reusability, testing

what does it mean to make code testable

team-specific on coding conventions. Each team is different in how they work, patterns they use etc.
usually you adapt or update them

Perfection doesn't exist. there's never no warnings or errors, especially as a project becomes big or old
Adaptability in your mindset

if you make a claim in your CV make sure you really know it, can back it up. Know the basics very well, read official docs. What's the newest thing happening in Java script, the most exciting

Know what they are, a bit of their history? Something to talk about the technology to explain their differences or use cases.

Be aware of the person you're talking about, if you're talking about your project the other person doesn't know about it 

Be curious, people like when questions are being asked. 

All conventions seem to be dependent on the different teams. So you can step in with your convention. 

Great job breaking down the pr into different commits, document it green flag good job Lauren

Tell a story with the PR 


receive feedback and improve. show growth by learning from the feedback, note it.

learn from good opensource projects. see if you can contribute

Terraform, infrastructure **


# find an open source .NET MAUI opensource project

- clone it and build it
- social aspect there that's not easy
- look at the code, see how it works 

if there is repetition in the code, look for a library 
collectionUtils.isEmptyTheList

if there's repetition look for a lib, if no lib make one

look at the implementation of methods and how they work

Debug code you haven't written. 

dev tools in JavaScript 

-----------

understanding your tools is very handy, know some of the shortcuts will make you more efficient

if there's a long way of doing something each time, there's probably a shortcut for that.

----

some things are standard within companies. there are always exceptions.

Adobe react spectrum.

there are differences between projects. 

As long as you're growing. Show your growth to yourself. 

"Leave the campsite better than you found it" it may be counter productive to fix all the problems, but you can fix a couple of issues.
Continuous improvement as a principle as a developer.

not as common to be on call in smaller companies.

bigger companies serve different time zones. 

CSO Critical systems outages

lots of little releases 

software engineering is creative backend and frontend 

look up the adobe software
enterprise software to digitize companies 

services and not just products

administration to admin thousands of licenses. share point etc.
loads of different services to facilitate these products

how to 

product person defines the roadmap 
different teams overall.

Hackathons

### big companies are more structured but more likely to do on-call
less companies serve less people are less likely to do on-call, less structured

across different companies and teams, workflows are not standardised. Neither are conventions. it's good and necessary to be adaptable, but also maybe to have a fundamental workflow you can follow yourself internally. basic principles, like the stand up "yesterday, today, tomorrow" formula.

- develop a formula of internal workflow principles; the external will fit on top of it

balance between tech and soft skills - is it someone I would love to work with?
- work on skills so they're at a level you do not take any time to figure out how to do it, then practice coding it or solutioning it

- hacker rank, leet code

continue to learn

demonstrate practical understanding of language concepts, and reusability testing
- look for repetition in the code, standardise a solution 
- what does it mean to make code testable? write testable code?

make sure you know something you put in your CV. Know the basics very well,
- go over CV, see if there's any you're not confident in
- read official docs

for interview
- what's the newest big thing happening in that language
-  be aware if the person you're talking to doesn't know your project. don't assume they understand things, agnostically describe things
- curiosity


PRs
- receive feedback and act on it. take note of feedback and where to apply it so you remember
-

Debug code you haven't written. 

-------------
understand your tools, find shortcuts to cut down on repetitive tasks
- debug in visual code
- identify a shortcut need. booting the avd?

"leave the campsite better than you found it"
- fix one thing at a time. it may not be better to fix everything at once.

- look at hackathons
