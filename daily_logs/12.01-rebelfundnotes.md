notes on Rebel fund going forward

behavioural changes,

outside vs inside stuff

development part of the app is for uni

not assessed on behavioural changes of students
not assessed on tree planting

something around campus
health app

redo the budget thing 


business competition
- bigger than uhi
- bigger, scaled up


take dev out of rebel fund

design hack for the applied research module**

summed up: Dev can't be part of the rebel fund, and behavioural changes and tree planting can't be marked as coursework. So that's fine, as both are sort of mutually exclusive anyway

Business competition to pay the devs. look at the application process
