figure out a design, just basic ui to base development around.


Make sure the project is viable with lecturers first 
Then requirements doc, pitchdeck etc

Whale holds up to 33 tons of carbon in its lifetime 80 - 90 years blue whale and humpback whale

"One whale can capture an average of 33 tons of carbon dioxide over its lifespan. A live oak tree, one of the most efficient carbon-capturing tree species, captures roughly 12 tons of carbon dioxide over a maximum 500-year lifespan."

Make the measurements smaller. 33 tons / 80 years for example

how the fuck
356 days in a year 
1000 kg in a tonne

33000 kg in 29220 days

kg / days
1.129 kg in a day?

then add that up to like weeks or something

Whales sequester 1.129 kg in a day of carbon

### do the same for the Oak tree

"Globally, marine phytoplankton capture the equivalent of four Amazon rainforests’ worth of carbon dioxide each year as they photosynthesize and produce half the oxygen we breathe."
