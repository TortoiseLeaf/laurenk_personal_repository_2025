Several apps exist I think mostly web

users input their purchases, travel etc so it seems quite labour intensive/requires interaction

this would be passive, calculates socials app use in the background and quietly generates reports.

Klima seems to be most similar to ours, it's a phone app that tracks your carbon footprint


Differences this would have - 

passive, just requires permissions to track app uses 

Benefits -

gamified aspect of being told the equivalents of carbon output you've spent or saved on apps
self-care/Tamagotchi aspect of measurable "this is good for me, I am taking control"
taking more control and autonomy back from corporations as a slightly more conscientious consumer.

Risks -
None?


social media management tools as well
