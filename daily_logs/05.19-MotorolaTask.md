`A = [100,100,100,-10]      D = ["2020-12-31", "2020-12-22", "2020-12-03", "2020-12-29"]`

should total them, deduct -5 a month each month of the year if this doesn't happen: that at least 3 card payments exceeds -100

process the dates first:
	if year of transactions is the same
		if month of transactions is the same
			if three of those transactions together totals -100 (nested loops?)
				continue,
				else add(-5) to transactions A
