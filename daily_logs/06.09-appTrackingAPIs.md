Potential technologies:
.NET MAUI (C#)
Flutter (Js/Java)
React Native

----
### Do Android first, they both have separate considerations and potentially double the work

MVP is android first, later ios
- need a vm to build with xcode
- need appstore approval to use their api


Android UsageStatsApi
Screentime for individual apps
requires usage access

IOS screentime API

Both treat app usage data as highly sensitive, what are best practices laid out by both platforms, technologies and GDPR to protect it? Write it up.

Weaknesses Flutter requires updates and dependency constraints

apparently net maui isn't as bad for that.

## Save device identifier

could try 

```scss
Android.Provider.Settings.Secure.GetString(Android.App.Application.Context.ContentResolver, Android.Provider.Settings.Secure.AndroidId)
```

but `READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` should only be given to system apps and not third party ones so in the meantime maybe just ask for the email address?

prompt user for a username or email address, try to save that to db immediately and reject it if it exists already in the db.

That way a profile is created for the user
