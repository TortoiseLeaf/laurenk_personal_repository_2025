I've been doing a kanban thing, loosely designed. 

Marta and Martin highlighted the necessity of locking down appropriate design documentation. This is priority. 

Okay so plan. Meet, discuss, draw up concise plans for core features/functionality.
onboarding document 

disseminate that into tasks. 

start sprint. 

I do have user profiles sort of 

develop archetypes, get motivations and frustrations 
user data of screen time users, do they already exist personas, most affected demographics?
focus groups, testers

Maybe a good idea to ask Heckie about how to successfully flesh out and use the personas to be useful for the app 
got requirements but not niche, could be made niche more criteria for testing too.

clear documentation and DoD helps scope creep. DoD for each sprint.



software feature costing it's like story points in jira.



Do the SRS bro you'll feel better for it. will there be DoD in that?

Get a documentation branch and put DoD and stuff in there

"### Definition of Done vs Acceptance Criteria

- **Acceptance criteria** describe _feature‐specific_ behaviour (e.g., “When the user enters an invalid email, show an error message”).
- **DoD** describes _global_ quality requirements (e.g., “Code reviewed, unit tests passing, documentation updated”)."


1. ~~Onboarding docs into branch, share to gc~~
2. DoD in there
3. SRS
