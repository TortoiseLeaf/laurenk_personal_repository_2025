# phone tracks screentime
- permissions
- tracks data


# Compares to last week

# minutes > CO2eq


# CO2eq into natural events


## set goals to reduce screentime:
saved per week

total the week stats for minutes saved (or co2eq?)

compare to previous week
can i store this for longer?
can i store the difference?


## calculate the weeks stats

total all minutes across the apps
total all co2eq across the apps per week

subtract that from previous week

show both values
you spent (mins) minutes less on your apps this week!
That was (co2eq) less CO2eq than last week!


-------
ISO 27001

clear policy outline commitment to data protection

conduct thorough risk assessment to identify threats and vulnerabilities to user data

data encryption, access control mechanisms and secure data storage/transmission

have procedures for incident response (look up a template?)

monitor and review to ensure effectiveness and relevance with the latest threats and regulation compliance.


GDPR

### look up data retention laws for personal data like screen time
30 days or more, could you waiver it in a T&C's or save your high score to the phone. anonymise it into a different db.
let's start with local db of personal bests.


be transparent about data collection and processing, explain the purpose and obtain explicit consent

only collect what's necessary obv

create clear procedures for users to wipe their data when they want. Delete it with the app for example? Or have a 'red button' to wipe it and start from anew?
like the Danger zone in repos in github

don't need DPA data processing agreements because no 3rd party services using the data

data protection considerations from the design stages of the app

---
use ISO 27001 and gdpr to create a framework for the project development

look at this link for monitoring and reporting systems to provide a total view of compliance efforts?
