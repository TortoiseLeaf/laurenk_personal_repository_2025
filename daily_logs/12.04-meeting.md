Overcomplicated. Martin would triple backflip just to cross a road


Where is .idea, is he using jetbrains IDE 

does that mean it's not showing up in visual studio?

because it's not running in mine
not running in Marta's either


~~- submit srs~~
~~- add uhi forms to ethics application~~
~~xUnit integrated~~


Marta's xUnit issues
when xUnit is added the ide
can't find the file to build 
one solution two projects, one xUnit

can it find the xUnit to build everything together



Onboarding docs add visual studio


add it as a service permissions separate to the consent page


copy paste test plan for consent 




abstract the database into an interface to then 


./MauiScreenTime/test/MauiScreenTimeTests/MauiScreenTimeTests.csproj

MauiScreenTime\test\MauiScreenTimeTests\MauiScreenTimeTests.csproj

      run: dotnet test test/MauiScreenTime/test/MauiScreenTimeTests/MauiScreenTimeTests.csproj --no-build --configuration Release --verbosity normal

try without the second test

try without MauiScreenTime/test/

## what does the PR do?
added a UsageStatsService with a method to check for usageStats permissions from Android, and open settings if none are found 

## Expected benefit
If permission is denied, settings page should pop up. If permission is granted, should log "log has permission granted" or similar

## Test Criteria
Run the app on the emulator. To remove permissions you can right click the emulator and "factory reset" from the avd manager.
