write that out into the QA Doc.

----------
Testing frameworks are xUnit 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/deployment/unit-testing?view=net-maui-9.0

Arrange - initialise objects and set the value of data used to test
Act - invoke method under test with required args
Assert - verify the behaviour is as expected.

	"As soon as a method has been written, unit tests should be written that verify the method's behavior in response to standard, boundary, and incorrect input data cases and check any explicit or implicit assumptions made by the code.".

can add an xUnit project to your solution with visual studio.

could use appium for ui tests
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/dotnet/maui-samples/uitest-appium-nunit/


does it need integration tests?

test the api works for the permissions thing?

test the api works for tracking the data.
check it stores data locally.

things to test:
- app loads
- data tracks
- data saves locally
- my app runs in background
- tracked app runs in foreground
- performance benchmarks?
- button redirects
- data displays
- bar clicks?
- co2eq calculation called?
- co2eq displays?
- natural comparison displays?
- is correct/relative to the amounts?


figure out a design, just basic ui to base development around.
