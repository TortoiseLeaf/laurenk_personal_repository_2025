it takes in parameters to model waves
generates wave model

wind etc

find the source code, for modelling?

it must be cross platform across OS'

fortran compiler no longer works on the latest windows OS and it must be x-compatible

look at its uses, competitors, if that might work.


Write a robust business plan that justifies why this project/product is valuable, fundable, and necessary.   It should include a cashflow forecast showing how the project/product development and deployment will be funded.  The business plan should be at a level whereby it could be presented to a funder to prove viability.
