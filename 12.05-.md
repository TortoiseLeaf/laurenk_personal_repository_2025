1. rebase dev onto branches
2. create an interface for the db 
3. usageStatsService


Marta has noticed the consent state is not persisting between reloads

check db saves correctly

data is saving correctly (Y)
revokes, deletes, everything, that's fine.

and db loads correctly
Where does it load

could be in the service too the navigation error because of the wait in the try catch

Fixed it was the db not injected into the startup service because the service missed a constructor






it was working before the merge so look at the code for that

consentviewmodel

Keep checking to find the original issue in old branch


## force delete changes on original splash to see old code


check the ethics application to see the framework for gdpr etc

not leading questions, open questions.

it's a living process, where you append stuff to the application for ethics.

ethical applications for equality stuff and accessibility

observation testing***

transcript the recording and anonymise it.
participants should be informed about how the data is used.
